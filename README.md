# QrScan

This is a simple mobile application with QR code scanning functionality. It is made using react native and Expo Go. It is a part of the ongoing semester project (2023) at AAU.

The user scans the QR code of a product with the application. Then this will show the whole supply chain information. This information is handled in the backend code with the IOTA tangle. The front end uses the API call to fetch all the information of the product scanned using the application. In every step of the supply chain, the validation information is present in the application to gain more reliability and trust from the consumers. Some of the pages from this application are show cased below:
